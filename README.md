# Project Description

The objective of this assignment was to create a data visualization dashboard using provided JSON data, 
a database of choice (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQL), and a front-end framework (Flask/Django, JavaScript/Bootstrap,
Angular, or React). The dashboard should display relevant insights from the data and feature interactive elements to enhance user engagement.

# Key Features
•	Database Integration: Implemented a database to store and manage the JSON data effectively.

•	Interactive Visualizations: Created engaging charts and graphs using libraries like D3.js, chart.js, plotly.js, Google Charts, or Highcharts to represent the data visually.

•	Dashboard Design: Developed a user-friendly dashboard layout using a chosen front-end framework, incorporating interactive elements and filters for a smoother user experience.

•	Data Insights: Designed visualizations that highlight key patterns, trends, and insights from the data, making it easier to understand and analyze.

•	API Integration: Implemented a Python API to retrieve data from the database and serve it to the dashboard dynamically.

# Technologies Used
•	Backend: Flask/Django

•	Frontend: JavaScript/Bootstrap, Angular, or React

•	Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQL

•	Visualization Libraries: D3.js, chart.js, plotly.js, Google Charts, or Highcharts

•	API: Python

•	Version Control: Git

# Files and Structure
This repository follows a structured organization:

•	data folder: Contains the provided JSON data (jsondata.json).

•	backend folder: Holds the Flask/Django backend code, including database interactions and API endpoints.

•	frontend folder: Contains the front-end code for the dashboard, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

•	visualization folder: Includes code for the visualizations, using various libraries like D3.js or chart.js.
